# ProbabilisticMultiview
Probabilistic object tracking using multiview cameras

This repository was designed for data collection and analysis from a binocular system in the United States Naval Academy's (USNA) Vision Integration in Polymanual Robotics (VIPER) Lab. 

A detailed explanation of the methods used can be found in the following:

Kutzer, "Probabilistic Object Tracking Using Quantified Camera Uncertainty Parameters in a Binocular System," 2024 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS), Chania - Crete, Greece, 2024, pp. 136-143, doi: 10.1109/ICUAS60882.2024.10556911.

Methods and code can be modified to integrate different tools and setups. 

The process for using the repository from start to finish in the VIPER lab is as follows:
